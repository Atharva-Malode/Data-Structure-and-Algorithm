Welcome to the readme file for the Data Structure and Algorithm project!

This project is designed to help you understand and implement various data structures and algorithms in a programming language of your choice. In this file, you will find information on the different data structures and algorithms included in this project and how to use them.

Data Structures:

Arrays: A collection of elements of the same data type that are stored in contiguous memory locations.

Linked Lists: A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list. The last node in the list typically has a null reference to indicate the end of the list. There are two main types of linked lists: singly linked lists and doubly linked lists.

Algorithms:
Sorting Algorithms: A set of algorithms used to put elements of a list in a certain order.
Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort

Searching Algorithms: A set of algorithms used to find a specific item in a collection of items.
Linear Search
Binary Search

Graph Algorithms: A set of algorithms used to solve problems related to graphs.
Breadth-First Search
Depth-First Search
Dijkstra's Algorithm

To use this project, you will need to have a basic understanding of C++.
