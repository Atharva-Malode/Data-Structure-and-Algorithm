        Graph : It is a data structure wich is used to store
                data which has some similar properties some real
                life examples is as follows.
        Examples :

        1)  lets take a example of freinds on face book they may have some similar connections
            or mutual freinds each inhibiting there own property.
            here freinds are node (vertices) and connection between them is edges.

        2) City connected by roads in a country or a state where the citys are the nodes(vertices)
           and the road is the edge.

        3) Devices over the internet connected to each other using NIC(network interface card) or
           port o of the application which connects to the router.


        => Ways of storing a graph
           1) Adjecent List      - Each Vertice stores a list/array of its neighbour.
                                   Advantage - Require minimum space.

           2) Adjecent Matrix    - we create a adjecency matrix
                                   Disadvantage - to much memory is needed.
                                                  need to iterate over a entire row to find a particular node.

           3) Edge List          -
           4) 2D Matrix (Implicit Graph)
